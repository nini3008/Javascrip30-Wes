I have gone through a lot of Javascript tutorials over the years and never really took my skill to the next level. This year, 2017...i decided to push myself and code as regularly as possible. I believe the best way to grow in any thing is to practice, practice, practice. Stumbled on WesBos on twitter and immediately knew i was the right audience for the Javascript30 course.

So i figured, whilst going/growing through this process, i'll document my experience, ideas on expanding each tutorial, and occasionally providing alternative solutions.

Finally, A big thank you to Wes Bos for creating a fantastic Javascript tutorial focused on just building stuff. If you want to learn quick and get comfortable fast in coding, i suggest you take this course and understand each tutorial thoroughly.
