Hi guys, I am Nicholas Iloba, Front-end developer and an enthusiast of all things Javascript. Over the years, I have gone through a lot of Javascript tutorials and never really took my skill to the next level. This year, 2017...I decided to push myself and code as regularly as possible. I believe the best way to grow in any thing is to practice, practice, practice. Stumbled on Wes Bos on twitter and immediately knew i was the right audience for the Javascript30 course.

So i figured, whilst going/growing through this process, i'll document my experience, ideas on expanding each tutorial, and occasionally providing alternative solutions.

Finally, A big thank you to Wes Bos for creating a fantastic Javascript tutorial focused on just building stuff. If you want to learn quick and get comfortable fast in coding, i suggest you take this course and understand each tutorial thoroughly.

So buckle up guys, its time to get past the

```javascript
let greetings = "Hello World";
console.log(greetings)

```
....build really cool apps. :)
